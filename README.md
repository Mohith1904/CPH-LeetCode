This extension can be used to get Graphical User Interface for managing test cases and can be used as a text editor for LeetCode problems. With this extension you can fetch, add, delete, run and check the output directly from the User Interface.

## Features

The main features of this extension include:-  
**Fetch TestCases:-** You can seamlessly fetch testcases of a problem using it's URL. In the Graphical User Interface, you can see the Input, Output and the actual output of your code.  
**Add TestCases:-** You can add your own custom testcases with a single click for a problem to see if your solution works fine.  
**Run TestCases:-** You can execute each testcase and display results in real time.  
**Delete TestCases:-** Easily remove testcases with a using the delete option for only custom testcases.  


## How It Works
Click `Ctrl+Shift+P` to open the command pallete and run the command **GUI LC CPH", from there you access the GUI that will be opened in the side window.   
The GUI will run code of the file that was active while running the command. If you want to run code for another file, please close the GUI and run the command mentioned again with active text editor being the file you want to run.  


## Why Use This Extension
Simplifies test case management.  
Unlike platforms like LeetCode's text editor, this extension lets you utilize VS Code's intelligent auto-completion and debugging tools to write and test your code more efficiently.  
Reduces context switching by integrating directly with your editor.  
Ideal for competitive programming, algorithm testing, and debugging is faster in local environment.
